##### !question

As an acquisition professional considering a Microservices-based approach, what eventual costs should you keep in mind?

##### !end-question

##### !options

* Distribution: Distributed systems are harder to program, since remote calls are slow and are always at risk of failure.
* Eventual Consistency: Maintaining strong consistency is extremely difficult for a distributed system, which means everyone has to manage eventual consistency.
* Operational Complexity: You need a mature operations team to manage lots of services, which are being redeployed regularly.
* Rigid Requirements: Due to the inflexible implementation requirements of Microservice systems, eventual change can be costly
