##### !question

Why do teams leverage both Divergent Thinking and Convergent Thinking when creating solutions?

##### !end-question

* They shouldn’t be leveraged in tandem; teams should focus on one or the other
* Using Divergent and Convergent thinking together enables hierarchical organizational constructs

##### !question

In the acquisitions setting, how are speed and security related?

##### !end-question

##### !options

* Security is the responsibility of one Functional of a Balanced Team, and speed is the concern of a different Functional
* If speed is the mission’s largest concern, the acquisition professional should consider on-premise solutions, rather than cloud-based
* Building securely from day one ensures time is not wasted fixing security issues after the fact

##### !question

The Government logistics team supporting an aircraft program needs to identify which aircraft parts have been deployed to the field, which parts have been installed on aircraft, and which parts need to be replenished. This information is currently maintained on an excel spreadsheet shared between multiple Government contractors and the Government logistics team.  

You will not have dedicated technical resources to work on or maintain any systems for at least the next 12 months, nor is it in scope of any of your existing contracts to fix this logistical headache. You need to get these parts tracked accurately ASAP. Assume information on the system is not classified, and there’s no need to work in a disconnected setting. Which of the following should you pursue?


##### !end-question

##### !question

Several years ago your program office issued a contract for the development of a custom software application, commonly referred to as SaaS. The initial contract required the contractor to build to a specific set of pre-defined requirements, including specific features of the software. After the initial fielding, the contract only provided for a minimal amount of labor hours to support maintenance of the software.   

However, in the current day, you’ve recently received access to a small team of technical resources and you’re interested in transforming both the software and the recurring cost of this software. There are also several custom features that your customer would like to have built into the software - all currently out of scope of the current contract that only provides for maintenance. Which of the following should you pursue?


##### !end-question

##### !options

* Identify who in the DoD is the customer of this product. Petition them for more funds.
* Start looking for PaaS or IaaS solution and supplement this with work and maintenance your technical team can do internally
* Begin the product inception process over again
* Cap the functionality of the software with the current features due to maintenance work being all that is on the current contract

##### !question

The DoD needs to modernize the way the Navy clears minefields in shipping lanes. These missions are currently planned and tracked with maps and Excel sheets noting map coordinates.

##### !end-question

##### !options

* Look for a third-party SaaS system with expensive but gold-standard support and high reliability
