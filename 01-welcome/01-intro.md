# Welcome to Digital DNA!

## Course Objectives: How this course will challenge (and sometimes frustrate) you

If the DoD wants to remain relevant, we must challenge ourselves and our ways of working. To fulfill that requirement, this course has been designed to do exactly that, and expects you to be aware of the trajectory of your learning, as well as be responsible for applying concepts as you learn them.  

### !callout-warning
## During this course, you’ll do expected things, like:
* Learn to leverage new technologies
* Gain new knowledge about acquiring digital products and services
### !end-callout


### !callout-info
## However, you’ll also be challenged to:
* Replace previously-standard workflows with more modern approaches
* Approach your work from a change perspective
### !end-callout

Learning to do this can be frustrating and tiring, but keep in mind, that is to be expected. You should feel a little off-balance- that means it's working. Even for those that have begun the journey to digital transformation, learning is a constant.

When reconsidering the way an acquisition team works together, we will explore the acquisitions process from the perspective of multiple roles, and explore the potential of truly cross-functional teams. Why does it matter if an PM or engineer knows about the contracting process? _It matters._ It’s not an accident that this course addresses these different perspectives. **Do not** ignore the portions that address roles other than your own.

Finally, this course will increase your effectiveness as an acquisition professional. If you find yourself trying to check the box of completion, you are doing it wrong. Our goal here is to provide you with the following:

* A learning opportunity
* Applicable content to your daily working life
* The ability to mentor others through their journey.

To understand why this course is so essential, read on.

## Background

You, the Software Acquisition Professional, are the cornerstone of how the DoD operates. This course focuses on you, because as our system users, you deserve a training experience that motivates and inspires you to continue learning and discovering new ways to solve the DoD’s most challenging problems.  
Defined as a member of the DoD acquisition workforce providing expertise in procurement, management, and/or development of software-intensive processes and systems (including business and weapons systems, supplies, etc), this course is designed to be leveraged by software practitioners, software acquisition professionals, and especially cross-functional software acquisition teams.

_Current course content is inspired by and leverages the efforts of open-source training content United States Digital Services (USDS) developed for the Digital Information Technology Acquisition Professional (DITAP) Training._

### !callout-success
## Reasons This is Important
**Mission Criticality:** First and foremost--we want to relentlessly reduce the time from identifying critical mission and business gaps to providing valuable capability into the hands of the warfighter!  

**Leadership is Asking:**  HON Ellen Lord, USD(A&S) said: “As we reorganize the way we do business, the thread that runs through all of our programs and all that we do is software [...] I believe that we need to catch up with the private sector, and make sure we are using contemporary software development processes.”  

**Supporting Studies:** There have been ~15 reports over the last 37 years addressing the DoD shortfalls in software delivery.   

**We’ve Been Mandated:** Congress in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) had multiple sections that addressed workforce development as it relates to software and digital technology:
  * **Sec. 230:** Policy on Talent management of Digital Expertise and Software Professionals
  * **Sec. 255:** Department-wide software science and technology strategy
  * **Sec. 256:** Artificial Intelligence education strategy, and
  * **Sec. 862:** Software Development and Software Acquisition Training and Management Programs  


> The Initial Report to Congress on Sec. 862 highlighted that:  _“In current defense acquisition training and management programs, knowledge of and experience in the fundamentals of modern approaches are in short supply, and acquisitions professionals like program managers and contracting officers often have limited familiarity with software and Agile development practices....These shortfalls add risk to DoD’s efforts to deliver quality software capability in a timely manner.”_  


### !end-callout
This course will change how acquisition teams are perceived, help others understand how they operate, and also define how they must navigate the process of applying regulation and laws that were _not written for a tech world._

## Initial Cohorts
To our early adopters (initial cohorts), we thank you for breaking ground with us. While we intend to discuss Agile methodologies in detail in future modules, here we are incorporating Agile processes in the following ways:

* **Start Small:** Both in number of students, and delivery of course modules (releases)
* **Iterate:** Multiple cohorts with a phased start, allowing for lessons learned and any other input to be incorporated with each new iteration. Cohort 1 < Cohort 2 < Cohort 3, etc.
* **User-Centered Design:** This course is designed with software acquisition professionals in mind. Releasing one module at a time and incorporating feedback allows us to validate not only the training content, but also the delivery method before making it available to the entire DoD Acquisitions workforce (approximately 180,0000).
* **Data-Driven Decisions:** Things facilitators and instructors will keep in mind as we design, iterate and improve the course:
 * How do we design training on topics that are constantly evolving?
 * How do we address participants' unique learning needs?
 * How do we shift individual and cultural mindsets?
