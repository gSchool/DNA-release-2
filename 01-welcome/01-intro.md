**Module 102: DevSecOps Foundations** is the second part of a deeper dive into the processes and technology that have so heavily influenced modern software development and technological innovation.   

For those who donâ€™t love technology and want to learn more about acquisition strategy, contract strategy, and management: bear with us. **Modules 103 and 104** will focus on those topics, but the information in _this_ Module will directly influence your ability to excel in those sections, and in turn will allow you to be a more effective acquisitions professional.

### Phasing Content
Course instructors will send reminders throughout the course to ensure you are completing content and progressing as you should be. The recommended phasing is beneficial, because it encourages you to get maximum interaction with learning guides, timely feedback on your answers, and prevents you from cramming all the content at the last minute.


### !callout-info
## Course Completion
* Remember that **all content** must be completed by **Wednesday , October 20th.**
* Before continuing on to Module 103, you must receive a grade of **80% or better** on the post-assessment.

## Key Reminders

As you are work through the content:

* **Key Takeaways:** We have created three (3) key takeaways for each individual lesson. Additionally, we are compiling a full list of all key takeaways as well as relevant resources for further study will be provided with successful completion of the course, and delivered in conjunction with your course certificate.

* **Resource Section:** Resource sections are intended to provide additional learning opportunities for students who wish to continue studying and completing research on their own. Selections will include articles, books, videos, and presentations that supplement the course content and further define topics we aren't able to cover in more depth.  

* **Bonus Sections:** These are *not* required - however, if the topic is interesting, directly impacting you, or you love to learn, these are available for your use.

* **Office Hours:** Office hours will continue to be offered. Feel free to drop in and speak with your learning guides about any part of the material or the program itself.
  * All attendees will receive calendar invites for Office Hours for dates throughout the two-week period of the module. *These are optional.*

* **Module Completion Certificates:** After completing content and receiving an 80% or greater we will provide a certificate with Continuous Learning Point (CLP) equivalent. 

We hope that you enjoy the course! As always, reach out to Tory or Christina if you have any questions.
