**Release 2: Digital Foundations** is the second part of a deeper dive into the processes and technology that have so heavily influenced modern software development and technological innovation.   

For those who donâ€™t love technology and want to learn more about acquisition strategy, contract strategy, and management: bear with us. Releases 3 and 4 will focus on those topics, but the information in _this_ Release will directly influence your ability to excel in those sections, and in turn will allow you to be a more effective acquisitions professional.
