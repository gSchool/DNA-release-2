# Welcome to Release 2 of Digital DNA!

### !callout-info
## Congratulations!
You are a quarter of the way through your Digital DNA journey. You are continuing on your learning journey to be a more effective and innovative software acquisition professional.
### !end-callout


**Release 2: Digital Foundations** is the second part of a deeper dive into the processes and technology that have so heavily influenced modern software development and technological innovation.   

For those who donâ€™t love technology and want to learn more about acquisition strategy, contract strategy, and management: bear with us. **Releases 3 and 4** will focus on those topics, but the information in _this_ Release will directly influence your ability to excel in those sections, and in turn will allow you to be a more effective acquisitions professional.

<!-- ======================= END CHALLENGE ======================= -->

Now to a few changes you may notice as you are working through:

* GRADING: In order to continue with the next Release of Digital DNA, you must receive **80% or greater on the post-assessment.**

* RESOURCE SECTION: We are only able to scratch the surface with these topics - we ruthlessly prioritized the information shared in the lessons to be mindful of your time but we do not want to prevent anyone from continuing to learn. The resource section found within most lessons will include articles, books, videos, and presentations that you are able to dive into if you want to get lost in learning.   

* BONUS SECTIONS: These are not required but are available if the topic is interesting, directly impacting you, or like the learning guides just love soaking up as much information as possible.  

* The last large change is that we will NOT hold any virtual sessions for this release. However, we will host office hours where you can drop in and speak with the learning guides about the material or ask program specific questions.  
  * You will be receiving calendar invites for Office Hours throughout the two-week period when Release 2 is offered. **These are optional.**  

* Also, we have created personalized Course Completion with Continuous Learning Point (CLP) equivalent information that we will send to all those that complete all self-paced material + virtual session!

 That concludes all of our updates. We hope that you enjoy the course, and as always do not hesitate to reach out to Tory or Christina if you have any questions!
