**Module 102: DevSecOps Foundations** is the second part of a deeper dive into the processes and technology that have so heavily influenced modern software development and technological innovation.   

For those who don’t love technology and want to learn more about acquisition strategy, contract strategy, and management: bear with us. **Modules 103 and 104** will focus on those topics, but the information in _this_ Module will directly influence your ability to excel in those sections, and in turn will allow you to be a more effective acquisitions professional.

## Updates

A few changes you may notice as you are working through:

* **Grading:** In order to continue with the next Module of Digital DNA, you must receive **80% or greater on the post-assessment.**

* **Key Takeaways:** For each individual lesson we have created three (3) key takeaways. We will also provide the entire list of key takeaways and resources as a PDF provided with course certificate. 

* **Resource Section:** 
   * We are only able to scratch the surface with these topics, but we do not want to prevent anyone from continuing to learn. 
   * Within most sections resources will include articles, books, videos, and presentations that you are able to dive into if you want to get lost in learning.  

* **Bonus Sections:** These are not required but are available if the topic is interesting, directly impacting you, or like the learning guides just love soaking up as much information as possible.  

* **Office Hours:** We will continue to host office hours where you can drop in and speak with the learning guides about the material or ask program specific questions.  
  * You will be receiving calendar invites for Office Hours throughout the two-week period when Module 102 is offered. **These are optional.**  

* Also, we have created personalized Course Completion with Continuous Learning Point (CLP) equivalent information that we will send to all those that complete all self-paced material + virtual session!

 We hope that you enjoy the course, and as always do not hesitate to reach out to Tory or Christina if you have any questions!
