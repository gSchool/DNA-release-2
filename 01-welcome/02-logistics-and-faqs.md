# Logistics and FAQs

## Logistics
Assimilation of course content is shaped by you, on your own time schedule. In-person sessions are not lectures- they will not “review” the asynchronous content. Rather, instructors will assume you have absorbed and understood that material, and will ask you to build and expand on your new understanding during sessions.

While the content completed on an individual basis is not reviewed in class, it will be monitored by the instructional team to ensure you’ve understood the concepts correctly, and are properly applying them.

They’re also there to get you unstuck -- If you have questions during the asynchronous portion, you can contact instructors directly or post questions on Microsoft Teams Channel

## Schedule
**Release 1** is a two week course, structured to be completed in conjunction with a user's current workload. The course is structured so that asynchronous content must be completed prior to virtual in-person sessions.

* Week 1: Release 1.A
* Week 2: Release 1.B

**NOTE:** A Thursday course-start is also part of the delivery experiment. This allows for asynchronous learning to be accomplished on Friday, with in-person sessions the following Wednesday.

**Cohort 2 Start Date: 3 December (Courses start and end on Thursday)**

Thank you for joining us, and remember we can change the flow of our day-to-day interactions and operations by understanding digital transformation as an enabler. It will be challenging to rethink how we employ our old methods today yet, with a different mindset we can design and deliver better user and mission capability. The challenge before us, is understanding that technology is ever changing and so are the mission and business needs that support our mission.  What got us here, won’t get us there….**Let’s explore more together!**

**What’s the structure of this course?**
There are two parts of this course: Part A and Part B. Part A takes place over the course of one week, with content you’ll need to complete prior to one in-person session.

Part B content will be revealed after your Part A in-person session, and you’ll have one week to complete this work prior to the second in-person session.

**When are the in-person sessions?**  

Part A - Wednesday 9 December 1300 - 1500 EST  

Part B - Wednesday 16 December 1400 - 1600 EST

**What should I be doing in between sessions?**
This course is mostly self-paced, so the majority of the work you’ll be doing with happen when you’re not in-person. You should complete all of the content in the Learn platform.
