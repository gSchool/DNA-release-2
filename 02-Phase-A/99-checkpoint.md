# Part A Checkpoint

Welcome to the assessment for Part A! This assessment will ask questions about the content learned so far. **Don't worry -- this is not a punitive assessment.** Rather, it's meant for you to gauge how well you've assimilated the information so far, and also allows your instructors to understand how you, and the rest of the class, are doing.

This assessment will challenge you, but try to complete it without using notes or Google. If you would like submit this assessment more than one time, contact your instructor.



### !callout-info
## However
We recommend you take a few minutes to review your course material _before_ starting this assessment. Feel free to close this Checkpoint and start it again once you feel ready.

##### !question

In the acquisitions setting, how are speed and security related?

##### !end-question

##### !options

* Slow and secure is the safest way for a digital acquisition team to work
* Speed and security are opposing ideas that teams need to balance properly
* Working with speed can increase security because it allows you to procure the most relevant products and respond more quickly to potential issues
* Security is the responsibility of one Functional of a Balanced Team, and speed is the concern of a different Functional
* If speed is the mission’s largest concern, the acquisition professional should consider on-premise solutions, rather than cloud-based
* Building securely from day one ensures time is not wasted fixing security issues after the fact

The DoD needs improve the accuracy of their inventory of items warfighters need to collect before their deployment. Inventory is currently maintained with pen and paper.  

You will not have dedicated technical resources to work on or maintain any systems for at least the next 24 months. You need to get this program off the ground ASAP.

##### !question

Three years ago, the DoD contracted with a commercial vendor to create a DoD-custom SaaS product. It’s been running successfully. There are no security concerns with the content on the product.   

However, as usage of the SaaS platform increases, your costs are scaling exponentially. You’ve recently received access to a small team of technical resources and you’re under pressure to decrease the long-term recurring cost of this solution. There are also more custom features you’d like to have built that are out of scope of the current contract. Which of the following should you pursue?


##### !end-question

##### !options

* Identify who in the DoD is the customer of this product. Petition them for more funds
* Start looking for PaaS or IaaS solution that costs less and supplement this with work and maintenance your technical team can do internally
* Begin the product inception process over again
* Decrease the functionality of the application so it uses less data and costs less

##### !question

The DoD needs to modernize the way it plans their tanker-refueling missions. These missions are currently planned with Excel sheets and whiteboards.    

This is a very high-profile problem, and it’s a well-funded project. The data is at a high security classification level. Due to the security level, access to the Internet or other data/communication networks are not accessible. Which of the following should you pursue?


##### !end-question

##### !options

* Look for a commercial SaaS system with expensive but gold-standard support and high reliability
* This project is currently impossible as scoped. Advise the team to continue with current solution.
* Propose an on-prem solution
* Propose a commercial IaaS system that will allow you to host sensitive data on their servers


##### !end-options

##### !answer

* Propose an on-prem solution

##### !end-answer

##### !explanation
In this scenario, internet access is not possible, which means you can't use a SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS solution (all of these rely on conenction to the internet). Also, the information is at a high security level, so you wouldn't want to put this on a commercial solution, Finally, you've got a lot of funding behind you, which means you can pursue the more expensive solutions like building your own infrastrucutre and having an internal team that maintains it.
