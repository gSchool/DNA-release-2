# Tech Like I’m Ten Part 1: The Cloud

### Learning Objectives
* Define the Cloud
* Explain how Cloud services directly relate to acquisitions, and your role as acquisitions professional

This lesson will teach you just enough to be effective with a few essential IT terms and concepts. You should be comfortable discussing them, but a deep understanding of how they work is not required.   


## Why You Need to Know These Technologies

### The Critical Role of Acquisitions

It has become clear the speed at which technology is changing commercial industry. Netflix, AirBnB, and Uber are all companies that began as start-ups, and greatly affected industries that had not been challenged in the past. As stated in that National Defense Strategy (NDS):   

![](../__images/strategy.jpg)

> “New commercial technology will change society and, ultimately, the character of war. The fact that many technology developments will come from the commercial sector means that state competitors and non-state actors will have access to them, a fact that risks eroding the conventional overmatch to which our Nation has grown accustomed.”  

We cannot integrate technology into our business and weapon systems without you, the acquisition professional. Your role is critical- you ensure that our program, contracting, and financial strategies can meet the pace of technology change.   

Developing a shared language and basic understanding of these concepts is essential to begin leveraging new ways for your program to deliver.

### The Cloud as an Enabling Technology
The Cloud has greatly decreased the price of entry, for anyone. In the past, what has hampered so many ideas or start-ups is the up-front investment cost.   

Take Netflix, for example. In the beginning Netflix offered a limited selection of movies and TV shows, and their primary source of revenue was their rent-by-mail alternative. Though the vision of their CEO was always an on-demand video streaming service, the company still had to remain profitable and prove feasibility. They waited over 10 years to offer on-demand streaming, because videos take up a huge amount of data storage, and the required computing bandwidth (Internet reliability) to match DVD-quality is enormous. So you see, it is not only the idea that matters, but also the timing--both in terms of consumers and supporting technology.    

In order to take their business to the Cloud, Netflix fielded their on-demand service with the Cloud provider **Amazon Web Services** (AWS) to provide the necessary Cloud services. This allowed Netflix to:  

* **Avoid** making large, up-front investments in terms of time and money.
 * AWS provided the data storage (servers) and redundancies (multiple storage locations) required to host high-quality video streaming, a major expense and delay had Netflix chosen to build it themselves.
* **Focus** on their unique on-demand video streaming service and cultivating a large library of options.  




### !callout-warning
## Remember
In the video, we note that one of the dangers of the Cloud is its similarity to an electricity bill -  you pay for it if you “leave it on”. You may also know that the Cloud can be costly even if usage is properly managed.    

Despite that, there are massive benefits to using the Cloud.

* Cost savings for you, the acquisitions professional
* Fast and secure acquisition of technology

* Securely access software apps and data from anywhere, using any computer or mobile device.
* Increased Reliability - Most providers deliver system uptimes of 99.99% or more because their infrastructure is architected with greater resiliency and redundancy than many small and medium-sized businesses could otherwise afford to ensure.

### Public, Private and Hybrid Cloud
For Netflix, the Cloud (in their case AWS) provided them with the opportunity to focus on their service/product, while providing reliable infrastructure and availability to support the demand of their customers.  

Hearing that example, the question becomes “Is it advantageous to purely use a Cloud service provider?”  

The answer: **it depends**. Though this may be frustrating, you will see it often as we move through the course. Individual situations differ, and adapting to what is best for each situation is much more effective than attempting a one-size fits all approach.

Companies often transition their whole product and subsequent data to a Cloud provider during their digital transformation. After this transition, the question becomes “What is most cost effective- solely using a Cloud service provider (_public Cloud_), building our own data centers (_private Cloud_), or leveraging both a public and a private Cloud (_hybrid model_)?”     

### !callout-success
## Industry examples of pubic, private, hybrid cloud
* **Netflix (Public Cloud)**: Netflix views their use of AWS as an operating cost. The advantage here is their ability to focus on other aspects of their streaming service, namely investing in their own original content. This is increasingly important with mounting competition from Disney+, Peacock, Hulu, and more.  

 “For Netflix, there is no competitive advantage for building their own data centers. In 2016, Netflix went live in 130 countries simultaneously. This would have been impossible if Netflix had to build their own data centers around the world. Netflix can pay AWS for its services because Netflix is getting paid too.” _Hoff, Todd. Explain the Cloud like I'm 10: Learn the Inner-Secrets behind Kindle, Netflix, AWS, Apple, Facebook, and Google. Possibility Outpost Inc., 2017._  

* **Dropbox (Private Cloud):** Dropbox started in AWS. Dropbox was able to build their platform and acquire customers without spending precious time and resources on building out infrastructure. AWS managed the infrastructure for them. Now Dropbox is established. They have a user base. They know what product they want to build. Which is why Dropbox is moving out of AWS. Dropbox is building out their own custom infrastructure that is tailored to their exact needs. This will reduce costs, increase profitability and allow them to better serve their customers (Hoff, 2017).  

* **BestBuy (Hybrid):** Like many companies, BestBuy expanded their online presence out of necessity, and for 11 months out of the year can predict their infrastructure requirements (data storage, availability, etc). But November is a different story- the surge in buying due to Black Friday creates an astronomical infrastructure need in comparison to the 11-month average. The Cloud offers elasticity on-demand, i.e. it expands and contracts to meet the need based on consumption. Because BestBuy cannot afford to lose the sales associated with Black Friday and the holiday season, they have chosen a hybrid option, paying only for services that support their surge in business, instead of for servers that will sit idle for months.

These examples show that often when a decision is made to optimize costs, the first step is migration to the Cloud. The DoD encounters scenarios where all of these models are appropriate. Disconnected operations, when either access to the Internet or other data/communication networks are not accessible and only on-premise data and applications can support operations, is a scenario where on-site infrastructure will likely be required. That means developing DoD mission critical applications to leverage Cloud services.

The Cloud is a well-documentated, reliable solution that's been tested over the course of many years.  
##### !end-explanation

##### !explanation-not: The business uses specific hardware configurations for specific systems
Remember, if your systems are super custom, you might not be able to find an existing Cloud provider that can work with your configurations.

Disconnected operations is a requirement for all DoD missions.

##### !end-question

##### !answer

* False

##### !end-answer

##### !explanation
Disconnected operations is a requirement for certain missions, but is not a blanket requirement for all DoD capabilities. The video highlighted ways that back-up and redundancy can be designed into applications. Examples: Google Maps and Kindle.  

* Google Maps – When you use Google Maps to get to your destination, the route loads to your phone in smaller pieces from the Cloud, who has access to a map, billions of data points, and also your location using GPS coordinates. The small pieces of data and their flow to your device allow you to continue to navigate even if you experience any intermittent connectivity issue.
* Amazon Kindle – Kindle is an application where you can see a device vs. see Cloud storage options. A Kindle allows you to download content based on available storage and/or when you have an Internet connection. The application tracks purchases, and shows the purchased digital product (e.g. book) on your Cloud library with an option of downloading to individual devices.
