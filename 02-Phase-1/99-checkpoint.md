#### !explanation
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle, incorporate automation and  learning to provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

Taking it further: It is a software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software development (Dev) and software operation (Ops). The main characteristic of the DevOps movement is to strongly advocate automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction, from integration, testing, releasing to deployment and infrastructure management. DevOps aims at shorter development cycles, increased deployment frequency, and more dependable releases, in close alignment with business objectives.

DevOps is NOT ENOUGH! DevSecOps is what must be implemented with the cybersecurity stack built-in into the DevOps pipeline.

#### !explanation
A network of computers, accessed over the internet, that provides some service; typically provided by a third party and not managed by users themselves.

Taking it further: These servers (the network of computers) are designed to either store and manage data, run applications, or deliver content or a service such as streaming videos, web mail, office productivity software, or social media. Instead of accessing files and data from a local or personal computer, you are accessing them online from any Internet-capable device—the information will be available anywhere you go and anytime you need it.

____________________ bring together people, process, and technology to enable an end-to-end experience. It is when an organization has already built a team to support digital service development, they call in seasoned product managers, engineers, and UX/UI designers to develop those services. Personnel involvement is predicated on the scope and type of digital services rendered (architects, security pros, testers, deployment engineers are all possible roles as well).

#### !explanation
**Based on previous answers and material taught in the course. This is the current definition of Open Source utilized within Digital DNA:**  

The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.

Taking it further: The term originated in the context of software development to designate a specific approach to creating computer programs. Today, however, "open source" designates a broader set of values—what we call "the open source way." Open source projects, products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development.
