#### !explanation
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle, incorporate automation and  learning to provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

Taking it further: It is a software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software development (Dev) and software operation (Ops). The main characteristic of the DevOps movement is to strongly advocate automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction, from integration, testing, releasing to deployment and infrastructure management. DevOps aims at shorter development cycles, increased deployment frequency, and more dependable releases, in close alignment with business objectives.

DevOps is NOT ENOUGH! DevSecOps is what must be implemented with the cybersecurity stack built-in into the DevOps pipeline.

Taking it further: These servers (the network of computers) are designed to either store and manage data, run applications, or deliver content or a service such as streaming videos, web mail, office productivity software, or social media. Instead of accessing files and data from a local or personal computer, you are accessing them online from any Internet-capable device—the information will be available anywhere you go and anytime you need it.
